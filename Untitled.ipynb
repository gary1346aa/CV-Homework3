    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "The goal of this project is to learn basic image recognition methods. Our real objective is to write some codes implementing scene recognition, starting with **tiny-images and Kth-nearest neighbor** and then move on to the state of the art method : **bags of features + linear SVC**.\n",

    "## Implementation\n",
    "### 1. Feature Extraction<br/>\n",
    "Before classifying images into scene categories, we need to do some pre-processing first. In this lab, we're going to use two methods to extract features from images, which is mentioned in the following blocks.<br/>\n",
